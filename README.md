`fact` is a program for bash that will tell you interesting and entirely true facts.
The design of the Fact Sphere, and all of the entirely 100% true facts it tells you
are copyright [Valve Corporation](http://www.valvesoftware.com/), and come from the
excellent game Portal 2. This program is just for fun, and the Enrichment Center
is not responsible for any bodily harm that might come to you as a result of
using `fact`.
