`fact` is a shell script (compatible with Bash, ksh, dash, and others) that
will tell you interesting and entirely true facts. The design of the Fact
Sphere, and all of the entirely 100% true facts it tells you are copyright
[Valve Corporation](http://www.valvesoftware.com/), and come from the
excellent game Portal 2.

This program is just for fun, and the Enrichment Center is not responsible
for any bodily harm that might come to you as a result of using `fact`.
